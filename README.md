# EBANX Software Engineer Project

### Project Description

This project is an implementation of a simple API requested by the EBANX challenge for the Software Engineer position. The API consists of two endpoints: GET /balance and POST /event. The goal is to create a system that can handle these requests, publish it on the internet using ngrok, and test it with a provided set of automated tests.
